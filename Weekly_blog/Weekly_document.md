This is the first week of my summer holiday and the beginning of my advanced project. In this week, me and my supervisor Jasper had the first online meeting and talked about my study interest as well as the structure of thesis. The start works including narrowing down research question, thinking about how to collect data, doing some case study.
Jasper also told me some thing need to pay attention to, such as the research question of thesis should be focus and specific.

My research interests lies on combining machine learning as a tool into live performance. There are three missions after class, first,finding gap in knowledge. Second, search for
exsiting technologies (accessible?). Third, think about technical innovation.


# week2 Jun19-25
This online meeting discussed about structure of thesis.
The outline of thesis usually include : 
1 Abstract(to tell people what this paper about); 
2 keywords;
3 Introduction;
4 Literature review;
5 Methodology;
6 Case study;
7 User study/Evaluation;
8 Discussion / Reflection.

I also narrowed my research topic which is how to build a interactive music generation tool? Instrument? which can make audience or composer interact with AI in real time.
This research topic rising is because using AI to assist music creation mainly focuses on generating symbolic music melodies and tunes, and some explore interactive music creation, but there is still a lack of research in live performances where the audience can also involve the sound, so I want to study how to let the audience participate in the music In the interaction of the performance, maybe to generate some harmony? Different melodies?

Do not have much progress. Found some papers in related field.
Read the paper called _Performing with a Generative Electronic Music Controller_

Today I found Ryan Kirkbride's wokr, a Python programming environment-- Foxdot and saw his video introducing Live code（Live coding concept）

Link for Foxdot is https://foxdot.org/
