This is the first week of my summer holiday and the beginning of my advanced project. In this week, me and my supervisor Jasper had the first online meeting and talked about my study interest as well as the structure of thesis. The start works including narrowing down research question, thinking about how to collect data, doing some case study.
Jasper also told me some thing need to pay attention to, such as the research question of thesis should be focus and specific.

My research interests lies on combining machine learning as a tool into live performance. There are three missions after class, first,finding gap in knowledge. Second, search for
exsiting technologies (accessible?). Third, think about technical innovation.
