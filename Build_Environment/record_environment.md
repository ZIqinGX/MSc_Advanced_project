## To make sure this program run correctly, first need to download and install several important library in environment and here are record of how I set right enviornment and what problem I met.

1. Create new environment<br/>
```
 conda create --name fyp1 python=3.11
 conda activate fyp1
 python -m pip install tensorflow
 conda install -c conda-forge -y pandas jupyter
 python -m ipykernel install --user --name fyp1
```
Now I have created a virtual environment called **fyp1**

2. Download library called **music21**<br/>
