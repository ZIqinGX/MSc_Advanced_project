# MSc_Advanced_project

Hi! This is repository for my Advanced project. It is the final course of my graduate career. It is a project about machine learning and human computer interaction.
This repository includes Readme about this project, code of this project and video link. 
I want to explore the collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence in improvisation and real-time performances.
